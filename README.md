Basic JS Math Game

This is a basic math game I took from an idea on the web. I needed some help looking up new math ideas for JS but hey, that is what learning to code is all about, right? 

This project taught me how to use math in my programming which is a valuable asset. Now I can generate different things by time and chance, using Random and Timeout.
